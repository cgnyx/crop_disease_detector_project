# **App Name**: Krishi Rakshak

## Core Features:

- Disease Detection: Analyze plant leaf images using a pre-trained ML model to identify potential diseases. The app will use a reasoning tool to handle cases with low confidence, offering alternative suggestions or prompting for clearer images.
- Result Presentation: Display disease name, confidence level, and a brief description of the ailment. Show images of other plants infected with this disease.
- Crop Selection: Allow users to specify the type of crop they are inspecting, narrowing the types of diseases that the model needs to consider, increasing accuracy. Focus initially on rice, groundnut and maize, common crops of the Karnataka region of India.
- Offline History: Store scan history locally on the device, so that farmers can see what detections were made in the past, without a network connection.
- Basic Treatment Advice: Provide farmers with locally stored, brief treatment advice. For now this will not be specific to the individual circumstances, and include a disclaimer about consulting expert advice.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy Green (#77DD77) to symbolize growth and nature, appealing to the agricultural context. This avoids the cliche of the color green literally suggesting money.
- Background color: Very light desaturated green (#F0FFF0) to provide a calming and neutral base.
- Accent color: Warm Yellow-Orange (#FFB347) for actionable elements, such as the button to initiate an image scan, to highlight important information.
- Simple, clear, legible font that works well in the local language(s).
- Intuitive, universally understandable icons (e.g., camera icon for image capture, magnifying glass for scanning).
- Clean, uncluttered layout with high information density, making the best possible use of available screen real estate.
